    "# Federated Machine Learning in PyTorch\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is a demonstration of _federated learning_, an approach to training a machine learning model by combining the results of training local models on multiple devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is part of a series intended to start from the basics to demonstrate federated learning in `pytorch`, then move on to test some of the bounds of what federated learning can (and can't) do.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Task: Digit Recognition\n",
    "\n",
    "For this demonstration, our task is a classic one: the MNIST digit recognition task. Specifically, we need to determine which number is written in an image of a handwritten digit like this one: \n",
    "\n",
    "![Handwritten digit \"6\"](images/example-6.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "To carry out this task we need a machine learning model to \"look\" at an image and classify it into a number. We also need and image data to train the model. We're going to use a simple convolutional neural network model. For the training images, we're using the well-known MNIST digits dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Approach: Federation\n",
    "\n",
    "The federated approach uses several _worker_ devices to train their own local models with independent data. That is, the workers each train their own local model with a subset of the full dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each worker trains its local model for a bit, then sends its incrementally trained local model back to a _manager_. The manager combines the local models from all of the workers into a master model, then sends the new master model back to the workers. This unit of processing is called a _round_. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then another round begins: the workers each train their local copy of the master model (creating another set of individualized local models), send those updated local models back to the manager. Once again the manager combines these individualized local models into a new master model, and pushes the new master model down to the workers. This cycle of rounds repeats as long as is necessary and useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Our Federation Library\n",
    "\n",
    "The `federated` library we're using here is a *simulation* of a federated network. It's not *true* federated learning because it uses one machine to simulate several indepedent machines. As a result of being on one machine, it does not have to deal with network communication or the timing problems inherent to real parallelism. But in our toy example the \"local\" models are independent in that they do not share data nor local models (except to the extent their models are combined) and that is sufficient to demonstrate the principles underlying federated learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our library includes a `FederatedManager` class and a `FederatedWorker` class. A `FederatedManager` contains a master prediction model and creates several independent `FederatedWorker` instances. Each `FederatedWorker` has its own local model and a distinct subset of the MNIST data."
